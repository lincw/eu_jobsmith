> The application UI is in Traditional Chinese, tailored to Taiwan's job-search conventions (104 / Cake / Yourator / LinkedIn).

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, and a logged-in **Claude Code** (`claude`) or **Codex CLI** (`codex`) on your `PATH`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin333353/taiwan-ai-job-copilot.git
cd taiwan-ai-job-copilot

setup.bat            # Windows  — one-time setup (venv + deps + frontend build)
# ./setup.sh         # macOS / Linux / Git Bash

desktop.bat          # launch as a native desktop window (recommended)
# run.bat            # or web mode → http://localhost:8000
```

### Running modes

| Mode             | Command                                                        | Notes                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desktop app**  | `desktop.bat` (or `python desktop.py`)                        | Native window; first run shows a backend picker + connection test. |
| **Web**          | `run.bat` (or `python -m uvicorn app.server:app --port 8000`) | Open <http://localhost:8000>.                                     |
| **CLI (one JD)** | `python -m app.cli data/demo_jobs/ai_engineer.txt`           | Headless single-JD run.                                            |

> Switch backend anytime from the onboarding screen or the top-right selector.

## Features

- **Auto job search** — paste or upload a résumé; the system derives keywords, searches 104 / Yourator / LinkedIn / Cake **in parallel**, and ranks results by fit in **streaming batches** (results appear as they are scored). Includes an adjustable "≥ N score" slider, pagination, and a per-company section for employers you name explicitly.
- **Skill-gap analysis** — aggregates the in-demand skills across matched jobs and contrasts them with your résumé to surface real gaps.
- **Search history** — every search is auto-saved (AI picks + named-company jobs + skill gap); revisit, regenerate a package, or delete. No more losing a great match to a re-run.
- **Résumé health check** — scores against Taiwan ATS conventions with concrete fixes and before/after rewrites.
- **Application-package workbench** — a multi-agent pipeline (parse JD → match score → company research → tailored résumé → cover letter → interview kit → critique) with a **human approval gate**. Outputs are editable inline and exportable to **Word (.docx)** (PDF via your browser's print dialog), then auto-saved.
- **Mock interview** — generates questions from the JD and your résumé, with per-answer feedback, scores, and a final summary.
- **Personalization** — remembers your most recent résumé (no re-upload) and preferences (target titles, tone, skills to emphasize) across sessions and applies them to outputs.

## LLM Backends

Pick your AI engine from the **top-right control panel** — a **local CLI subscription** (no API key) or **BYOK** (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Selecting a backend takes effect immediately; the **Test** button is an optional connection check, never a gate. Local CLIs have a **rescan** action and a **selectable model**.

| Backend      | Auth                                   | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude_cli` | Claude Code subscription               | **Default.** No API key; strips `ANTHROPIC_*` env. Model selectable (auto-tiered by default).            |
| `codex_cli`  | Codex subscription                     | No API key. Model selectable; defaults to your Codex config.                                             |
| `openai`     | BYOK — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint  | `base_url` + `api_key` + `model`. Works with OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM… |

CLI subscriptions run **locally** and bind to the logged-in CLI on your machine, so your résumé never leaves your computer. BYOK credentials are written only to your local `.env` and never transmitted. An API-key backend (`anthropic`) also exists for self-hosting or CI.

```

- A LangGraph `StateGraph` orchestrates the agents; `SqliteSaver` persists checkpoints and powers the human-in-the-loop approval gate via `interrupt()` / `Command(resume=…)`.
- The server streams progress to the browser over **Server-Sent Events**.
- An application-level SQLite database (separate from the LangGraph checkpoint store) holds package history, user memory, and saved searches.
- Models are tiered automatically: **haiku** for extraction, **sonnet** for matching/generation, **opus** for the Critic/Supervisor.

## Evaluation

Does the Supervisor reflection loop (Critic → revise un-passed documents → re-critique) actually improve output quality? A small golden set of 5 job/résumé pairs is run with reflection **off** (no revisions) and **on**, and the resulting Critic scores are compared:

<!-- EVAL:START -->
| Reflection | Critic pass rate | Mean quality score |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Off        | 60% (3/5)        | 85.6               |
| **On**     | **100% (5/5)**   | **87.5**           |

Reflection lifts the Critic pass rate by **+40pp** (60% → 100%) and mean quality by **+1.9** (85.6 → 87.5) across the 5 golden cases. Both "off" failures were cover letters making **unverified company claims** or an **unsupported experience claim** — exactly what the Critic → revise loop catches. _(One harness run; LLM calls are non-deterministic, so exact numbers vary run to run.)_
<!-- EVAL:END -->

```bash
python -m app.evals.harness     # runs the graph on each golden case, writes app/evals/results.json
```

The `summarize()` step is a pure function with its own unit tests, so the aggregation logic is verified independently of the (non-deterministic) LLM calls.
